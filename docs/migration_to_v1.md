# Migration guide for the V1 version

### Introduction

This guide will cover the following:

- Migrating to the V1 version from the `main` version

- Migrating to the V1 version from the `development` version

### Important changes in V1

V1 is just a port of the development version into main. It does, however, include a lot of important changes that are not available in the `main` V0 version. Those changes include:

- Access scopes for Google login

- Offline mode for Google login

- Unification of the different implementations.
  
  - Extensive testing was conducted to ensure that all implementations of the Google Provider behave in the same way between platforms

### Migration from the V0 main version

- Changes in the `MainActivity.java` for Android
  
  - Please follow the [Google Setup Guide](./setup_google.md). Specifically, please search for `MainActivity.java`

Changes in the `MainActivity.java` for Android
